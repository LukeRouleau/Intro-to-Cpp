# Intro-to-Cpp
In the first year of my learning to program, I transitioned from Java to learning C++. These are some of my introductory exercises and projects.


Lab 1 - Basic OOP
  Create a "Car Dealership" database using basic OOP in C++
  
Lab 2 - Basic IO & Error Throwing 
  Create a basic CMD line app and throw errors for invalid inputs
  
Lab 3 - Array Based Stack & Queue Template Classes with "Big Three"
  Your ABS and ABQ will be template classes, and thus will be able to hold any data type.
  Because these classes will be using dynamic memory, you must be sure to define The Big Three: Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment Operator, Destructor
  Data will be stored using a dynamically allocated array (hence the array-based stack and queue).
