# Intro-to-Cpp
In the first year of my learning to program, I transitioned from Java to learning C++. These are some of my introductory exercises and projects.


Lab 1 - Basic OOP
  Create a "Car Dealership" database using basic OOP in C++
  
Lab 2 - Basic IO & Error Throwing 
  Create a basic CMD line app and throw errors for invalid inputs
  
Lab 3 - Array Based Stack & Queue Template Classes with "Big Three"
  Create Array-Based (dynamically allocated) Stack and Queue template class data structures. Use the "Big Three" since the memory is dynamically allocated.
