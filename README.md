# Intro-to-Cpp
In the first year of my learning to program, I transitioned from Java to learning C++. These are some of my introductory exercises and projects.

## [Labs](./Labs)

### [Lab 1 - Basic OOP](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab1%20-%20Basic%20OOP)
  Create a "Car Dealership" database using basic OOP in C++
  
### [Lab 2 - Basic IO & Error Throwing](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab2%20-%20Basic%20IO%20%26%20Errors) 
  Create a basic CMD line app and throw errors for invalid inputs
  
### [Lab 3 - Array Based Stack & Queue Template Classes with "Big Three"](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab3%20-%20Template%20Classes%20%26%20Big%20Three)
  Create Array-Based (dynamically allocated) Stack and Queue template class data structures. 
  Use the "Big Three" since the memory is dynamically allocated.
  
### [Lab 4 - File IO Database](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab4%20-%20File%20IO)
  Use File IO to write and read from CSV files to create a database.

### [Lab 5 - Binary File IO](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab5%20-%20Binary%20File%20IO)
  Read binary files containing a database of fictionalized "Starships".
  
### [Lab 6 - Classes with Inheritance](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab6%20-%20Classes%20with%20Inheritance)
  Create classes for various geometric shapes with inheritance relationships.
  
### [Lab 7 - Random Number Generator Dice Roller & CSV File Database for the US States](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab7%20-%20Random%20Numbers%20%26%20CSV%20Database)
  Create two applications:  (1) Use a random number generator to create a N sided die roller 
                            (2) Create a CSV Database IO app to store data about US states.
  
### [Lab 8 - Color Selector](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Labs/Lab8%20-%20Color%20Selector)
  Read in files describing colors and create a color selector app.

  Create a templated linked list class data structure.

### [Project 2 - Image Processing](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Projects/P2%20-%20Image%20Processing%20Project)
  Read in image files, process them, and then display them.

### [Project 3 - Minesweeper Game](https://github.com/LukeRouleau/Intro-to-Cpp/tree/main/Projects/P3%20-%20Minesweeper%20Project)
  Create a minesweeper game using the SFML graphic library.
